**Xamarin is not responsible for, nor does it grant any licenses to, third-party packages. Some packages may require or install dependencies which are governed by additional licenses.**

Note: This component depends on [Google Maps SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/), which is subject to Google's Terms of Service and Policies. Pay attention particularly to the following aspects:

 - Depending on your app and use case, you may be required to display attribution. Read more here for 
   [Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/intro#attribution_requirements) and for 
   [Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/ios-api/attributions).
 - Your API usage is subject to quota limitations. Read more about usage limits for 
   [Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/) and for 
   [Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/ios-api/usage).
 - The [Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms) are a comprehensive description of the legal contract 
   that you enter with Google by using the Google Maps SDK for iOS. You may want to pay special attention to 
   [section 10](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms#10-license-restrictions), as it talks in detail about what you 
   can do with the APIs, and what you can't.
